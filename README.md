# BaseXXX Pro

![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/RainPPR/base-code-extended) ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-brightgreen)

**BaseXXX Pro** is a modern, high-performance web-based encoder and decoder utility. It is designed with a focus on aesthetics (Glassmorphism) and versatility, supporting a wide array of Base encoding formats ranging from standard Hex and Base64 to custom Chinese character encoding schemes.

> **Note**: This project is client-side only. No data is sent to any server.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX

- **Glassmorphism Design**: Frosted glass panels, dynamic background animations and fluid transitions.
- **Responsive Layout**: optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Customizable Interface**: Toggle specific encoders on/off to suit your needs and improve performance.
- **Dark Mode Native**: Built with a deep, contrast-friendly color palette (Slate 900 + Neon Accents).

### 🔢 Extensive Encoding Support

BaseXXX Pro supports real-time conversion for the following formats:

- **Standard Formats**
  - **Base16 (Hex)**: Standard hexadecimal encoding.
  - **Base64**: Web-safe standard encoding (RFC 4648).
  - **Base85**: Adobe Ascii85 implementation.

- **Integer/Alphabet Bases**
  - **Base10**: Decimal representation.
  - **Base26**: A-Z (Case Insensitive).
  - **Base36**: 0-9, A-Z (Case Insensitive).
  - **Base52**: A-Z, a-z (Case Sensitive).
  - **Base62**: 0-9, A-Z, a-z (Case Sensitive).
  - **Base94**: All ASCII printable characters.

- **Special/Experimental**
  - **BaseCN-Common**: Chinese Core Characters (Commonly used \u4E00-\u9FFF + \u3007).
  - **BaseCN-Extended**: Full Chinese CJK range coverage.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) to run this application. No backend server or build process is required.

### Installation / Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RainPPR/base-code-extended.git
    cd base-code-extended
    ```

2. **Open the application**:
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

    Or serve it locally using Python (optional):

    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
    # Open http://localhost:8000
    ```

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Core**: Semantic HTML5, CSS3 Variables.
- **Scripting**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
  - Uses `BigInt` for arbitrary-precision arithmetic in integer-based encodings.
  - Uses `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder` for byte-safe string manipulation.
- **Icons**: [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/).
- **Fonts**: [Space Grotesk](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Grotesk) & [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans).

## 🤝 Contributing

**This project is primarily self-maintained.**

I created this tool for my own use and to explore specific UI/UX concepts. While I am happy to receive feedback, please note the following regarding contributions:

- **Bug Reports & Fixes**: ✅ Highly appreciated! If you find a conversion error or a UI bug, please open an issue or submit a PR.
- **Documentation**: ✅ Typos, clarifications, or translation improvements are welcome.
- **Feature Requests**: ⚠️ I have limited bandwidth to maintain this project. Major feature additions (e.g., adding 50 new bases, backend integration) might not be accepted unless they strictly align with the project's core vision and require zero maintenance overhead.
